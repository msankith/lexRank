NEW DELHI—A massive cyclone lashed coastal areas of southern India Sunday morning with winds of up to 112 miles an hour and torrential rain, killing at least six people and uprooting trees, damaging houses and crops and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate their homes.
Three people were killed in coastal Andhra Pradesh Sunday, according to the state’s disaster management department.
Meteorologists said the cyclone was “very severe.” Wind speeds peaked at about 121 miles an hour but by evening had dropped to about 81 miles an hour, said Laxman Singh Rathore, director-general of the Meteorological Department.
In India, about five cyclones develop over the north of the Indian Ocean every year shortly before or after the June-to-September monsoon season.
To avoid a breakdown in communication, authorities in Andhra Pradesh have been equipped with satellite phones.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised “all possible assistance in relief and rescue operations,” his office said in a statement Sunday.
